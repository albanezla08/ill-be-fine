# ill-be-fine

I'll Be Fine is a tower defense game I made with 3 other designers as part of a project in our program, the School of Interactive Arts, for the annual Games for Change Festival. You follow the inner emotions of a single mother during the pandemic as you keep stressors out of her mind and gradually realize that mental health is about more than putting up walls.

I worked on the code for most systems such as menus, buying/placing towers, dialogue, and enemy spawning as well as the behavior for a few towers. Additionally, I contributed to many aspects of game and narrative design, such as theming, the map layout, tower abilities, and progression. This project was coded with Unity using C#.
